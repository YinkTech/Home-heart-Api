# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)
# item1 = House.create(title: "Chipotle Nachos", description: "Chipotle", location:"Build a plate of nachos with all of your favorite fixings", price:"$600", image:"hi.jpg")
